Used Technologies

1. React
Framework: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components.

2. JavaScript (ES6+)
Language: The application is built using modern JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, and destructuring assignments.

3. CSS
Styling: CSS is used for styling the application. This includes both global styles and component-specific styles (like the services and blog sections).
Responsive Design: Media queries are used to ensure the app looks good on various screen sizes.

4. Fetch API / Axios
Data Fetching: The application uses the Fetch API (or Axios, if you choose) to make HTTP requests to retrieve blog data from an external API.

5. Bootstrap
UI Framework: Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-styled components and a responsive grid system, making it easier to create a responsive layout. If youâ€™re using React Bootstrap, it allows the integration of Bootstrap components as React components.

6. React Router 
Routing: React Router can be used to handle client-side routing. This allows for navigation between different views without reloading the page.

7. Version Control (Git)
Source Control: Git is often used for version control, allowing you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage the codebase effectively.

8. Development Environment
Node.js: Node.js is used as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser, particularly for server-side applications and tooling.
